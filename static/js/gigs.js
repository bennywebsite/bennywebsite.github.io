  bio1: "British singer songwriter Benedict Cork has been receiving praise from all over the shop. Elton John: “sensational … a name to look out for,” Clash Magazine: “an artist unafraid to let his emotions pour out on a record.”",

  bio2: "Benedict released his first EP ‘Piano Tapes’ over the summer of 2018, a completely live performance of 5 tracks recorded at Red Gate Recorders in LA. This was followed by his first single of 2019 ’Therapy,’ a sweeping piano ballad exploring themes of mental health and self love.",

  bio3: "Most recently, Benedict supported Brit Award winner Tom Walker and Grammy nominated Emily King and co-wrote Adam Lambert’s current single ‘Feel Something’ which Rolling Stone called “an achingly yearning ballad.” He returns with his second single of the year ‘Fear Of Lonely’, exploring the loneliness of moving to a new country after a break-up - written during Benedict’s time living in Stockholm, Sweden.",
