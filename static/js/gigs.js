  bio1: "Benedict released his first EP ‘Piano Tapes’ over the summer of 2018, a completely live performance of five tracks recorded at Red Gate Recorders in LA, which garnered support from Elton John who called lead track ‘Ghost’ ‘sensational’ and Benedict ‘a name to look out for.’",

  bio2: "This was followed by his second EP ‘Letters To Strangers’ in August 2019, a collection of six songs recorded between London, LA and Stockholm over the past year and released month by month alongside a residency called ‘Benedict Cork & Friends’ at Fiction Studios.",

  bio3: "Most recently, Benedict has supported Brit Award winner Tom Walker, Grammy nominated Emily King, co-written Adam Lambert’s single ‘Feel Something’ which Rolling Stone called “an achingly yearning ballad” and appeared on the BST Hyde Park festival bill supporting Stevie Wonder & Lionel Richie.",
